# Express Version of Rate Your Landlord Backend

## Start Dev Server

```DEBUG=rate-your-landlord-express:* npm start``

## Todo

- normalize JSON response so that it mirrors what rails backend serves
  - start with trying to roll my own
  - after that use Sequelize :-)
  - refactor project structure to mirror node-pg documentation?
  - add extra hacky attrs to reviews JSON
  - POST/PATCH/DELETE routes bruh
  - set random image for landlord from UNSPLASH like RoR
