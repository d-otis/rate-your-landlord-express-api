# Express Version of Rate Your Landlord Backend

## Start Dev Server

```DEBUG=rate-your-landlord-express:* npm start``

## Todo

- normalize JSON response so that it mirrors what rails backend serves
- start with trying to roll my own
- after that use Sequelize :-)
- refactor project structure to mirror node-pg documentation?
- add extra hacky attrs to reviews JSON
- set random image for landlord from UNSPLASH like RoR
- hacky landlord rating and property updates when reviews are created
- make sure adding review => updates ratings for landlord and property
- load mocking data with JS instead of Ruby
- enforce strict consistency with underscore vs camelCase
- fix circular dependency issue by offloading helper functions into their own modules
